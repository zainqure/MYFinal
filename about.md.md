# About This Site

This website was created as the final project for my course on information organization.  
It brings together everything I learned throughout the semester and demonstrates how to build a complete, organized, and user-friendly digital resource.  

### Purpose
- To show how information can be structured clearly  
- To practice using **Markdown** for content creation  
- To apply principles of **classification, categorization, and navigation**  
- To create a polished project that can be used as a **portfolio piece**  

### What You’ll Find
The site is divided into six main categories:
1. **Foundations of Organizing** – Basics of why organization matters  
2. **Resources & Markdown** – Tools and benefits of Markdown  
3. **Describing Resources** – Using metadata and YAML  
4. **Creating Categories** – Strategies for grouping information  
5. **Classification & Structure** – Systems and methods of classification  
6. **Interacting with Information** – Navigation, links, and user experience  
7. **Publishing & Managing Knowledge** – Preparing, maintaining, and portfolio value  

### Author’s Note
This project reflects both theory and practice. It not only explains concepts but also shows them in action through the structure and navigation of the site itself.
