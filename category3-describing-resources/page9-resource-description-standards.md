# What is Resource Description?

Resource description is the process of explaining what a resource is, so people can find and use it effectively. A resource could be a book, a website, a video, or even a dataset.  

When we describe resources, we provide **context** that makes them meaningful and discoverable.

## Examples of Resource Description

- A **book**: title, author, publication year, subject.  
- A **website**: page title, keywords, short summary.  
- A **photo**: caption, date taken, tags.

## Why It Matters

Without clear descriptions, resources become invisible. Imagine a library where books have no labels — finding anything would be nearly impossible.
