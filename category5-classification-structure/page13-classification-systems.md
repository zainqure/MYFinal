# Classification Systems

A **classification system** is a way to organize information into categories based on shared features.  

### Common Examples
- **Library systems** – Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress  
- **Biology** – species, genus, family, order  
- **Retail** – clothing, electronics, groceries  

### Why It Matters
Classification reduces chaos and makes it easier to search, compare, and retrieve information.
