# Case Study: Classification

Let’s look at an example of classification in action.

### Example: Online Store
- **Hierarchy:**  
  - Electronics → Computers → Laptops  
- **Tags:**  
  - "On Sale", "Gaming", "Lightweight"  

### Why This Works
- The hierarchy gives structure  
- Tags add flexibility so users can filter items in different ways  

This mix of methods makes the site both **organized** and **user-friendly**.
