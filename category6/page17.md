# Linking Strategies

Links connect pages and guide users through your site. Strong linking improves both **navigation** and **understanding**.

### Types of Links
- **Internal links** – connect pages within your site  
- **External links** – point to outside sources  
- **Contextual links** – added in text for deeper reading  

### Best Practices
- Make links descriptive, not just “click here”  
- Ensure no broken links  
- Use links to show relationships between pages
