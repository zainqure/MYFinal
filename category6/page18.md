# User Experience

**User Experience (UX)** is how people feel when they interact with your site. Good UX makes information easy to find and pleasant to use.

### Elements of Good UX
- **Clarity** – simple, clear design  
- **Speed** – pages load quickly  
- **Consistency** – same tone and structure across the site  
- **Accessibility** – works for everyone, including people with disabilities  

### Why It Matters
A site with poor UX frustrates users, while a site with good UX keeps them engaged.
