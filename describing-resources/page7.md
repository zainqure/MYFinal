# Metadata and Tags

Metadata means "data about data." It gives structured information that helps identify and locate resources. Tags are keywords added to resources to group and connect them.

## Metadata Examples

- A **video**: title, length, upload date, creator.  
- An **academic paper**: author, abstract, DOI, keywords.  
- A **music track**: artist, album, genre, duration.

## Tags

Tags are user-generated keywords that describe a resource in a flexible way. They are common on social media, blogs, and digital libraries.  

**Example:**  
- A photo of pizza might have tags: *food, pizza, Italian, dinner*.  

Tags help connect related content across categories.

## Why Metadata and Tags Work Together

- Metadata gives **structure** (consistent fields).  
- Tags add **flexibility** (user-driven discovery).
