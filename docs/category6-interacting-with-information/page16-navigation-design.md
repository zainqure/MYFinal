# Navigation Design

Navigation design is about helping users move through your site easily. A good navigation system makes information **findable** and **usable**.

### Key Principles
- Keep it **simple** – don’t overwhelm with too many choices  
- Be **consistent** – use the same layout across pages  
- Show **hierarchy** – organize links from general to specific  

### Example
A recipe site might use:
- Home | Starters | Mains | Desserts | Contact
