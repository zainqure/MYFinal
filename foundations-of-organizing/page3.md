# Real-World Examples of Organizing

Organization is everywhere around us. It’s not limited to libraries or computers—it shapes how we live and work daily.

## Libraries

Libraries use classification systems like the **Dewey Decimal System** to organize books. This ensures that anyone can find a book quickly based on subject.

## Digital Information

- **Websites** use menus and categories to guide users.  
- **Search Engines** organize billions of web pages with algorithms.  
- **Social Media** uses hashtags and recommendations to group content.  

---

## Daily Routines

Even small tasks depend on organization:  
- Grocery stores place similar products together (milk, cheese, yogurt).  
- Calendars keep events in order by date.  
- Email uses folders or labels to sort messages.
