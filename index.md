# Welcome to My Project Site

This site is the final project for my course. It brings together everything I learned about **organizing, describing, and publishing information** using Markdown.  
It is divided into seven main categories:

- [Foundations of Organizing](category1/foundations-of-organizing.md)
- [Resources & Markdown](category2/resources-markdown.md)
- [Describing Resources](category3/describing-resources.md)
- [Creating Categories](category4/creating-categories.md)
- [Classification & Structure](category5/classification-structure.md)
- [Interacting with Information](category6/interacting-with-information.md)
- [Publishing & Managing Knowledge](category7/publishing-managing-knowledge.md)
