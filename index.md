# Welcome to My Project Site

This site is the final project for my course. It brings together everything I learned about **organizing, describing, and publishing information** using Markdown.  
It is divided into seven main categories:

- [Foundations of Organizing](foundations-of-organizing/index.md)
- [Resources & Markdown](resources-markdown/index.md)
- [Describing Resources](describing-resources/index.md)
- [Creating Categories](creating-categories/index.md)
- [Classification & Structure](classification-structure/index.md)
- [Interacting with Information](interacting-with-information/index.md)
- [Publishing & Managing Knowledge](publishing-managing-knowledge/index.md)
