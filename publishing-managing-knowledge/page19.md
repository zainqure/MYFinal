# Preparing for Publication

Before publishing a site, it’s important to make sure everything is polished and ready.

### Checklist
- Review content for clarity and typos  
- Check for broken links  
- Ensure consistent formatting  
- Test navigation on different devices  

### Why This Matters
A site that feels **unfinished** can frustrate users. Preparing carefully ensures professionalism and trust.
