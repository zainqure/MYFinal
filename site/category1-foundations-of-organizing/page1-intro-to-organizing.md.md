# Introduction to Organizing

Organizing is the process of arranging information, objects, or ideas in a way that makes them easier to find, understand, and use. Without organization, information becomes overwhelming and confusing.  

Think about your computer: when files are scattered everywhere, it’s hard to locate what you need. But if those files are placed into labeled folders, it’s faster and easier to navigate. The same idea applies to how we organize digital information on websites, databases, or even in libraries.
