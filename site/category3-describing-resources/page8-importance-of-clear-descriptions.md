Clear descriptions ensure that resources are accessible, understandable, and useful. Without them, even the best information can go unnoticed.

## Benefits of Clear Descriptions

1. **Discoverability** – People can find resources quickly.  
2. **Usability** – Users know what a resource contains before opening it.  
3. **Accessibility** – Descriptions help users with different needs, such as screen readers.  
4. **Context** – Provides meaning and relevance.

## Everyday Examples

- A recipe blog post with tags like *dessert, chocolate, easy bake*.
