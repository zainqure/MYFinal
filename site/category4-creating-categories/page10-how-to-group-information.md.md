# How to Group Information

Organizing information starts with grouping similar items together. This makes it easier for people to find and understand what they need.

### Strategies for Grouping
- **By topic** – group related content together (e.g., recipes, news, tutorials)  
- **By audience** – organize based on who will use the information  
- **By format** – group documents, images, videos separately  

### Example
In a recipe website:  
- Starters  
- Main Dishes  
- Desserts  

This logical grouping helps readers navigate smoothly.
