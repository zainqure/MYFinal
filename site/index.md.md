f# Welcome to My Project Site

This site is the final project for my course. It brings together everything I learned about **organizing, describing, and publishing information** using Markdown.  
It is divided into seven main categories:

- [Foundations of Organizing](page1-intro-to-organizing.md.md)  
- [Resources & Markdown](page4-what-is-markdown.md.md)  
- [Describing Resources](page7-metadata-basics.md.md)  
- [Creating Categories](page10-how-to-group-information.md.md)  
- [Classification & Structure](page13-classification-systems.md.md)  
- [Interacting with Information](page16-navigation-design.md.md)  
- [Publishing & Managing Knowledge](page19-preparing-for-publication.md.md)
